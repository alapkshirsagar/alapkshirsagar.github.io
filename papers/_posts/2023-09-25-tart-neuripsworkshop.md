# Abstract
This paper investigates active sensing strategies that employ vision-based tactile
sensors for robotic perception and classification of fabric textures. We formalize the
active sampling problem in the context of tactile fabric recognition and provide an
implementation of information-theoretic exploration strategies based on minimizing
predictive entropy and variance of probabilistic neural network classifiers. By
evaluating our method on a real robotic system, we find that the choice of the active
exploration strategy has a relatively minor influence on the recognition accuracy
as long as the objects are touched more than once. In a comparison study, while
humans achieve 66.9% recognition accuracy, our best approach reaches 90.0%,
showing that vision-based tactile sensors are highly effective for fabric recognition.
