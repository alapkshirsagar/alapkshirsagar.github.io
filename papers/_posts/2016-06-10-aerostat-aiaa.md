# Abstract
This paper presents a mathematical model for predicting the motion of an
aerostat after tether breakage. Aerostats are equipped with emergency deflation valves for
safe recovery of payload in case of accidental tether breakage. The trajectory of breakaway
aerostat depends on the number and locations of these valves. The dynamic simulation of the
aerostat is done by setting up and solving equations of motion in three dimensional spaces,
considering the effect of added mass, aerodynamic forces and wind velocity. The model is
implemented in MATLAB and simulation results are generated for input data of a sample
aerostat. Comparison of aerostat trajectories for different valve configurations is presented
along with some inferences.
