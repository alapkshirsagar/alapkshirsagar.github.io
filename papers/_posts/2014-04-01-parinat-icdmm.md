# Abstract
This paper describes the mechatronic design of a small size humanoid robot, developed under the project ‘Parinat’ at IIT
Bombay. The robot has 12 degrees of freedom (DoF), with 3 DoF in each limb. The height of the robot is 30cm and it
weighs around 1.8kg. It is capable of demonstrating basic human like motions such as walking, dancing etc. without any
torso arrangement or weight shifting mechanism. The mechanical structure is made up of modular U-shaped brackets,
manufactured in-house, for mounting servo motors which are used as actuators. The walking speed of Parinat-1 is
around 30mm/sec. The robot is able to turn through 5 degrees in each unit step. Detailed design process of the robot,
simulations for calculating torque requirements of servo motors, walking gait analysis, power supply and control systems
are presented in this paper.
