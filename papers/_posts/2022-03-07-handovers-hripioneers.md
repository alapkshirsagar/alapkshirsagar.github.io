# Abstract
This work investigates the collaborative task of
object handovers between a human and a robot, a central
aspect of human-robot collaboration. Our research contributes
along three directions: first, designing robot controllers for
previously unexplored human-robot handover scenarios; second,
investigating gaze behaviors of a receiver in human-to-human
and human-to-robot handovers; and third, investigating human
behavior in bimanual and multiple sequential human-to-human
handovers. Our contributions could help enable robots perform
the complex but essential tasks of handing over objects to and
receiving objects from humans.
