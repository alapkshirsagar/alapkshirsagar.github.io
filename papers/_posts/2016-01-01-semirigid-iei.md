# Abstract

This paper describes how a semi-rigid airship is designed and fabricated within specified dimensional
limits. The design of Semi-rigid airship is crucial as it is dependent on numerous parameters such
as structural weight, material, envelope shape, overall size, payload requirements, etc. Along with
the functional parameters various other parameters are also considered, such as the portability of the
structure, Envelope attachment to the structure, payload mounting, etc. are also considered. Along
with that different tests, such as Helium Leak detection and making structural samples for checking
strength, are performed so as to ensure that there is minimum variation in conceptual and actual design.
The paper describes entire design and fabrication process followed to design a Semi-Rigid Airship as
small as 4m in length which is capable of carrying a considerable amount of payload. The paper shows
the process used for selecting a proper envelope shape and size according to design requirements.
Rigid structure able to be dismantle is used as the structure of the airship. The weight of the structure
is a critical parameter and hence various types of materials are considered. The paper not only gives an
approach for design and fabrication, but also shows how the fabrication is carried out.
