# Abstract
This work aims at asymptotically accurate dimensional reduction of non-linear multi-functional filmfabric laminates having specific application in design of envelopes for High Altitude Airships (HAA). The
film-fabric laminate for airship envelope consists of a woven fabric core coated with thin films on each face.
These films provide UV protection and Helium leakage prevention, while the core provides required structural
strength. This problem is both geometrically and materially non-linear. To incorporate the geometric non-linearity,
generalized warping functions are used and finite deformations are allowed. The material non-linearity is handled
by using hyper-elastic material models for each layer. The development begins with three-dimensional (3-D)
nonlinear elasticity and mathematically splits the analysis into a one-dimensional through-the-thickness analysis
and a two-dimensional (2-D) plate analysis. The through-the-thickness analysis provides the 2-D constitutive law
which is then given as an input to the 2-D reference surface analysis. The dimensional reduction is carried out
using Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) for moderate strains and very small thickness-to-wavelength ratio.
It features the identification and utilization of additional small parameters such as ratio of thicknesses and stiffness
coefficients of core and films. Closed form analytical expressions for warping functions and 2-D constitutive law
of the film-fabric laminate are obtained.
