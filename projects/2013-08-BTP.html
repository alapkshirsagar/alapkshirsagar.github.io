<ul>
<li>Evaluated and compared the performance of various mobility systems based on metrics like obstacle
climbing capability, power consumption and effective ground pressure</li>
<li>Developed a physics based motion dynamics simulation tool in MATLAB, incorporating the forward
dynamics of rocker bogie system, wheel-soil interaction mechanics and drive motor characteristics</li>
<li>Analysed the effect of wheel dimensions on mobility performance of rocker bogie system and devised
look-up tables for autonomous reconfiguration of wheel dimensions</li>
</ul>
