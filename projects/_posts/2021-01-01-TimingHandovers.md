In this project, we develop and evaluate human-robot handover controllers that allow end-users to specify timing parameters for the robot reach motion, and that provide feedback if the robot cannot satisfy those constraints. End-user tuning with feedback is a useful controller feature in settings where robots have to be re-programmed for varying task requirements but end-users do not have programming knowledge.
