Developed a novel image processing algorithm to extract tangent space data from digital colour images of
one dimensional (1-D) deformable objects like ropes, wires etc.<br>
Built framework in MATLAB for obtaining manipulation trajectory of 1-D deformable objects during robot learning from demonstration scenarios<br>
Developed simulation of 1-D deformable object manipulation tasks by industrial robots FANUC
LRmate200iD, using Remote Application Programming Interface (API) between V-REP and MATLAB<br>
