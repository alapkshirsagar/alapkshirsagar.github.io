Evaluated and compared the performance of various mobility systems based on metrics like obstacle
climbing capability, power consumption and effective ground pressure<br>
Developed a physics based motion dynamics simulation tool in MATLAB, incorporating the forward
dynamics of rocker bogie system, wheel-soil interaction mechanics and drive motor characteristics<br>
Analysed the effect of wheel dimensions on mobility performance of rocker bogie system and devised
look-up tables for autonomous reconfiguration of wheel dimensions<br>
