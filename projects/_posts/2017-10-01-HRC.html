<p align="justify">
Built a platform for human-robot collaborative task execution by combining off-the-shelf robot arm, simple-head robot and a vision sensor. Connected these individual components through a main controller in ROS framework
<br>
Developed high-level decision-making algorithm based on teamwork requirements found in HRI literature
<br>
Conducted human-subject experiments to compare the likeability and task efficiency of robot arm with and without the tablet-head
