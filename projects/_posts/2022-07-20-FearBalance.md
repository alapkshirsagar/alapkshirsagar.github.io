Fear of falling has been found to correlate with increased postural sway, i.e. the oscillations of the center of pressure (CoP) that we experience even while standing quietly.  Attempts at a deeper understanding of this correlation have tied behavioral to neurophysiological changes, but a rigorous computational explanation for the behavioral and neurophysiological changes is currently lacking. In this project, we seek to understand how do the computational goals underlying human balance control change when standing at a height. 

This project is a collaboration between Cognitive Scientists from Philipps-Universität Marburg (Germany) and Robotics Researchers from Technische Universität Darmstadt (Germany), as a part of [The Adaptive Mind](https://www.theadaptivemind.de/) researh cluster.
