In this project, we investigate human-robot handover controllers that are automatically synthesized from high-level specifications. In contrast to existing controllers, this approach can provide formal guarantees on the timing of each of the handover phases. Using synthesis also allows end-users to specify and dynamically change the robotâ€™s behaviors using high-level requirements of goals and constraints rather than by tuning low-level controller parameters.
