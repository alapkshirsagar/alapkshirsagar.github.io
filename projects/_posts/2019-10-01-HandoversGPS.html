This project studies model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to train a robot controller for human-robot object handovers. RL is a promising approach to develop handover policies, but existing methods did not consider important aspects of human-robot handovers, namely large spatial variations in reach locations, moving targets, and generalizing over mass changes induced by the object being handed over. We report on promising benefits, but also limitations of existing RL methods for this HRI task.
