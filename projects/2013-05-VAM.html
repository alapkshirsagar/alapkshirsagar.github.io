<ul>
<li>Developed asymptotically correct constitutive model of multi-layered film-fabric laminates with potential application in reliable design of High Altitude Airship envelopes</li>
<li>Conducted independent research built upon two separate methodologies developed for hyperelastic shells and composite sandwich plates by former doctoral and masters students of lab</li>
<li>Implemented the nonlinear 3-D hyperelastic shell formulation for 3 layers followed by dimensional reduction based on Variational Asymptotic Method, using MATHEMATICA</li>
