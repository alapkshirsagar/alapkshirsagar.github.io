<h3>
Day : 2
<br> Location: Mont Blanc, Chamonix) (France)
</h3>

<p align="justify"> The ‘Gandhi Jayanti’ day for us began with the ‘all-you-can-eat’ breakfast at our hotel in Lyon. After the breakfast, we started our journey towards the highest mountain in Alps ‘Mont Blanc’! The bus dropped us at the ‘Chamonix’ town near the base of Mont Blanc. From there we were supposed to take a cable-car to reach the top viewing-point of the mountain.  We were already very much excited and the glimpses of the peak from the bus raised our excitement exponentially!

<p align="justify"> But nature had a different plan! The temperature on the peak was -16degree Celsius and combined with the strong wind the real feel was -25degree celsius. The cable car was temporarily shut down due to these extreme weather conditions. So our tour organizers decided to give us a couple of hours to explore the Chamonix town and get some food. Cursing our luck, we started walking around the town. Chamonix was a beautiful small commune surrounded by mountains and trees.

<p align="justify"> We had some food at a cafe and then strolled along a road outside the town to get a closer look at Mont Blanc.

<p align="justify">  It was a spectacular sight indeed! Our (professional!) photographers (Prayaag and Silva) clicked some awesome pictures of the peak.

<p align="justify">  The splendid sight of Mont Blanc left us wanting for more. But the cable car did not start. After spending a couple of hours around the town, we got back to the bus and continued our journey towards the final destination of this tour: ‘Geneva’.
